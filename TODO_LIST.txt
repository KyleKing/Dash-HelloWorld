- TODO: add implements/interface
- PLANNED: for Dash Dev
	- Maybe collect TODO/FIXME and add to README
	- Replace snoop with loguru

- PLANNED: Create dash app for viewing loguru logs
	- filtered/searchable table with columns time stamp, level, message, source, etc
	- Click on row for 'extras' which shows JSON formatted data below table (Button?)
	- Navigate to next file in the directory
		- Maybe show a ToC with time stamps and number of lines. Maybe last line?
	- PLANNED: Implement TODO feature list for the datatable with Kitsu exploratory app!
		- Data table
			- Show using the column lookup for markdown formatting, number of decimal places, etc.
			- Implement modal that can open on button click

- FIXME: Use `.set_keynames(x='x', y='y', color='TBD', **kwargs)` where kwargs are specific to chart type and are specified in the interface
	- Add way to specify the x/y axis key names separate of the labels. See plotly express as an example syntax
- FIXME: Improve performance of the JSON Cache using SQL directly rather than datasette for handling larger data sets
	- Could consider grouping the dictionaries first, but SQL is likely better

- PLANNED: Try adding types to Dash Charts (see packages that can auto-assign types)
- PLANNED: Try out the class improvements such as attrs and data classes
	- DOIT-API and auto class from smarie
	- Funcy, Fastcore, other?

- PLANNED: Add infrastructure to override/extend the CSS and JS: http://dash.plotly.com/external-resources
	- Create temporary directory merged with user specified content? Accept string custom_css like the static ones do?

- TODO: Add DataCache and store meta tables to the README (and implement an example)

- PLANNED: app_px
	- Add tab to view preview of all data frames found in px
	- Add ability to select data source (CSV, JSON, SQlite, etc.) with upload module
		- data upload is in top bar where user can use dcc.upload to pick the file - https://dash.plot.ly/dash-core-components/upload
		- Maybe modal appears on load to select how to tidy data, how to load (is JSON in records or other format?) or which table from SQL to load
		- Button to toggle back to the default data set per chart
	- Show general data statistics from pandas describe!

- PLANNED: sparklines (status: nothing right now)
	- create new sparklines figures

- PLANNED: Test datatable (All)
- PLANNED: test utils_callbacks.get_triggered_id() > put in a demo app?
- Round up other TODOs/FIXMEs from source code

- PLANNED: ESRI Inspiration:
	- View guidelines on TS from ESRI: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/help/serial-chart.htm
		- Maybe update rolling chart to use recommendations from ESRI?
	- Build indicator like in ESRI: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/help/indicator.htm
	- Built ESRI Event list: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/help/list.htm
